## Dev environment tips

Use Nix dev shell for executing commands. It contains programs
that the default shell may lack.

## Style conventions

- try to reuse already written code as much as possible
- when possible, do not exceed code line length of 72 columns
- keep code comments to minimum 
- use descriptive names inside code to minimize need for adding comments 
- when writing any key-value pair data structures, sort keys alphabetically

## Workflow

- use conventional commit messages
